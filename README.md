Meteor Storm Concepts to Implement:
- Make the overall map easier to the eye - palette and tile system (discuss this with Heitzman tomorrow)
- Teleportation System to two cities - part of the way to solve the puzzle of the destroyed car
	- Destroyed Car
		- First main mission of the game is to get past the destroyed car.
- What items should be available in the store?
	- 9mm Glock 
	- Baseball Bat (the store owner says this is a useless item, nod to Earthbound)
	- Med Kit (restores set amount of health)

- Player Apartment
	- Way to save the game
	- If you die in the game, revert back to your last save


- Enemy AI
	- follow you like in Earthbound and will try to attack
	- need to work on Enemy AI animation sprites
	- they do respawn
